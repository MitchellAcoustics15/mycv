Free free to modify the tex file to create your own resume. 

Please don't use my resume for anything else without my permission!

# Credits:
Thanks to Claud D. Park's awesome-cv class (https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) and academicons author James Walsh (https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/academicons)!

# What I did:
I modified a little bit awesome-cv.cls and academicons.sty.

I also used academicons for ResearchGate and GoogleScholar icons.

I downloaded the academicons latex, extracted it and put the font in the fonts folder, so I do not need to install the packages and fonts.
